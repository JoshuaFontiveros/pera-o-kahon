# Pera O Kahon JavaScript Game
This website was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is our first-ever game project from Uplift Code Camp. This is my first JavaScript game inspired by Kuya Wil and required by Uplift Code Camp. By the way, in english, pera is money and kahon is box.

This game is a game of chance. Here's the instructions of how the game works:
* We have 10 boxes on this game.
* On those 10 boxes, the user will need to eliminate the first 3 boxes.
* There's a chance that the iuser will eliminate one or two of the main prizes, that's okay. But if the user have eliminated all the prizes, you can restart the game by clicking the button restart.
* If the user have not eliminated all the main prizes, then 4th box is the user's last chance to win the other prizes
* The host will ask the user to choose between pera o kahon.
* If the user choose pera, the user will take the offered money with what amount the user accumulated everytime he/she chooses kahon.
* If the user chose box all the way to the end, and that box contains bokya, the user will receive nothing.
* Otherwise, if that box contains the any of the 3 main prizes, then user won!
* FYI: Mega Jackpot is both One Million Pesos & House & Lot prize!
